This programme uses STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) [#]_ to transfer each column of image,
interpreted as frequency domain data into time domain in LTR (left-to-right) order. That is,
it makes an image display in a spectrogram [#]_.

- Hiding flags in CTFs [#]_.
- Hiding ... (you know what I mean :smirk:)
